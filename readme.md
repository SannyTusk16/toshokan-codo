### The core idea behind this is a module/library based Vibecoding IDE. Instead of writing code from scratch,
### we use AI to glue together modules of our application. 

### i plan on implementing a public library of configurable templates into this project, and tons of prebuilt sites.

## the reason i came up with this:

Vibecoding is boring AF. No one likes waiting minutes, if not hours for cursor/github copilot/ basically any VibecodeIDE to finish coding their site. Plus maintaining their site is hectic. We gotta dig through hundreds of AI-Generated code to find the error/ wait for ai to painfully analyze its own code and then fall into an endless contextless loop of errors. 

## my lame thoughts:

i thought, what if we have "modules" which are already prewritten, and ai just glues together these modules, in a matter of seconds.

this makes code easily understandable too. i can just browse the modules and see whats wrong.
